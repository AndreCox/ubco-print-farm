# UBCO Print Farm

## About

This project aims to create a print farm for the UBCO Makerspace and document all steps so that it can be expanded and updated in the future. This repo contains all software and documentation that has been written to make this possible. This project can also be useful for any other people who need to create a print farm in a network environment that has a secured WiFi such as a university or school.
