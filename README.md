# Hardware Components

I'm still refining what exact hardware is needed but here is a brief list.

### Raspberry Pi 4 B+ (one for each printer)

These will run Octoprint to connect to the 3D printers. In the future I will change this to 1 computer with a USB hub that can support a larger number of printers as buying Raspberry Pi's for all printers is a waste of money.

### Network Switch

An unmanaged network switch will be used to connect the raspberry pi's together and provide them with internet. This should cost about 100$ for a 16 Port Gigabit Switch.
